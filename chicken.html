    <p>We cook the spiced tomato mixture until the fat breaks out into droplets on the surface. This is an indication
        that the moisture content has reduced sufficiently to intensify flavors.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>300 grams chicken</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon yoghurt (curd)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 green chilli</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon refined oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric/li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 tablespoon gram flour (besan)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 tomato</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
            <li>As required</li>

        
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the chicken nicely and pat dry the meat. Add it to a bowl and marinate it by adding ginger garlic paste, 1/2 tsp cumin powder, yoghurt, ½ tsp turmeric powder, ½ tsp Kashmiri chilli, ½ tsp salt and 1 tbsp besan. Let this sit for 15 minutes and then cook these pieces in hot oil. Take them out of the pan and keep aside.</li></br>
        <li>n 2 tbsp of oil, add some mustard seeds and let them splutter. Once they calm down, add the cumin seeds, hing, ginger-garlic paste and finely chopped onions. Cook this until the onions start to turn translucent. Add the spices at this point and quickly add chopped tomatoes. Cook this until the tomatoes are soft and the oil starts coming to the surface.</li></br>
        <li>At this point, add the cooked chicken pieces, and coat them well in the mixture. Add 1 cup of water and cover. Let this cook for about 10 minutes or until the oil comes to the surface. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve with rice or chapati.</li></br>
    </ol>
