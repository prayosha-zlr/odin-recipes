    <h1>Hii, WELCOME TO MY DHABA </h1>
    <img src="dhaba.jpg" alt="Dhaba" >
    <h3> Two types of food are served in our dhabas ---<strong>non-vegetarian cuisine (which is the most popular)</strong> and <strong>vegetarian fare termed vaishno dhabas (where food is cooked in pure ghee or clarified white butter)</strong>. </h3>
    <h4>Dal makhni is a popular dish in the vegetarian dhaba</h4>
    <p>We use a lot of freshly ground whole spices. <br>These spices not only increase the taste and flavour, but enhance the aroma as well. Another reason why they use whole spices is, they are cheaper than the powdered spices.</p>
